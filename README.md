# HackWestern 9 Project (Pashu)
Worldwide, there have been over a million cases of animal cruelty over the past decade. With people stuck at home, bottling up their frustrations. Moreover, due to COVID, these numbers arenâ€™t going down anytime soon. To tackle these issues, we built this game, which has features like:

Reminiscent of city-building simulators like Sim-City.
Build and manage your animal shelter.
Learn to manage finances, take care of animals, set up adoption drives.
Grow and expand your shelter by taking in homeless animals, and giving them a life.
The game is built with Unity game engine, and runs on WebGL, utilizing the power of Wix Velo, which allows us to quickly host and distribute the game across platforms from a single code base.
